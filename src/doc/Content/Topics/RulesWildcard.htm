        <h1>Wildcards</h1>
        <p>The wildcard (“*”) matches any element tag. You cannot use the wildcard to match attributes.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you need to match an element with a unique quality and the kind of element is unimportant. For example, your style guide recommends using a true em-dash character (“—”) instead of a double hyphen (“--”). However, it is acceptable to use a double-hyphen in programming code, which is in <code>pre</code> elements. Therefore, the <code>when</code> sections have to enumerate each of the elements for which a double-hyphen could incorrectly appear:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">when:&#160;self-text p "--"<br />when: self-text li "--"<br />when:&#160;self text td "--"
when: self-text h1 "--"
when: self-text h2 "--"
when: self-text h3 "--"
when: self-text h4 "--"
when: self-text h5 "--"
when: self-text h6 "--"

test: fail
</pre>
        <p>This is a tedious, error-prone way to match double-hyphens, especially because the type of element is not important but the element’s content is. You can simplify these  sections to a single <code>when</code> section with a wildcard (“*”) and enumerate the only case where it’s acceptable in the <code>test</code> section:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">when:&#160;self-text * "--"

test: self pre</pre>
        <p>This simplified <code>when</code> section matches any element that contains a double-hyphen then the <code>test</code> section ensures the double-hyphen appears in the only acceptable element, <code>pre</code>.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you can simplify a rule with a wildcard in a <code>test</code> section. For example, if your team does not allow exclamation marks at the end of paragraphs, list items, and table cells, you would write the following <code>when</code> sections:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">when: self p<br />when: self li
when: self td</pre>
        <p>To test these elements, you could write the following corresponding <code>test</code> sections:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">test: not self-ends p "!"<br />test: not self-ends li "!"
test: not self-ends td "!"</pre>
        <p>But you can reduce multiple <code>test</code> sections to a single <code>test</code> section by using the wildcard (“*”):</p><pre xml:space="preserve">test: not self-ends * "!"</pre>
        <p> The simplified <code>test</code> section applies to any of the matches found by the <code>when</code> sections.</p>
